                <h3>Why gutter energy?</h3>
              <p> 
                The conception of Gutter Energy was created by three physicists in Oslo.
                 Living in a city where rain happens on a very regular occasion,
                 and where the city river Akerselva runs freely throughout the city, 
                 they started discussing why the hydroelectrical energy potential was not utilized at all. 
                 By using Norway’s highly developed hydroelectrical technology,
                 they have already implemented turbines throughout the sewers of the country’s most profound rain city – Bergen.

                <h3>How gutter energy works?</h3>
               <p>In Norway heavy rain is normal, and a tremendous amount of water 
                  must be led through gutters and through sewers before it reaches 
                  either a river or the ocean. By utilizing the immense powers of 
                    the water traveling below our feet, Gutter Energy has made it possible 
                    to create sustainable and green energy out of the resources that 
                    already exist in a city. The turbines installed in the sewer tunnels
                     have a relatively low-cost production and require between low to 
                     no maintenance, as the use of strong metals will keep them spinning for tens of years.

                <h3>Our goal</h3>
                <p>Our initial goal is to implement Gutter Energy to every big Scandinavian city. 
                    Furthermore, we aspire to install our systems in every European city where 
                    there annually is a substantial amount of rain downfall. This would make our
                    continent a more sustainable home for not only us, but also for animals 
                    the nature surrounding our historic cities. Cities will be more independent, 
                    with a goal of creating a minimum of 35% of electricity solely from the waters
                    beneath our feet.

                <h3>About the creators</h3>
                <p>Emil Hengy, Sony Ericsson and William James met as students at NTNU Trondheim,
                     where they all studied to become physicists. Both Ericsson and James moved to 
                     Norway’s capitol, Oslo to start working for Green Energy directly after their 
                     studies where they quickly got to lead their own project team. Emil Hengy has 
                     worked for Sustainable Waters since one year pre-graduation. In 2017 the trident
                      once again teamed up to discuss starting their own business based on the
                       experience they had gathered up through the past years. This is how Gutter
                        Energy was created, and the rest is soon to be history.
